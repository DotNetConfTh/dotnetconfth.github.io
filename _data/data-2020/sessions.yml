  photo: sirinat.jpg
  description: "Bridge to Kubernetes allows you to run and debug code on your development computer, while still connected to your Kubernetes cluster with the rest of your application or services.
Bridge to Kubernetes avoids having to build and deploy your code to your cluster by instead creating a connection directly between your development computer and your cluster.
Connecting your development computer to your cluster while debugging allows you to quickly test and develop your service in the context of the full application without creating any Docker or Kubernetes configuration."

  Map entity types to queries: This functionality, which was actually previously available, has been improved and sports new syntax.

  Event counters: '.NET event counters are a way to efficiently expose performance metrics from an application. EF Core 5.0 includes event counters under the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore category.'
  Property bags: 'EF Core 5.0 allows the same CLR type to be mapped to multiple different entity types. Such types are known as shared-type entity types. This feature combined with indexer properties (included in preview 1) allows property bags to be used as entity type.'
